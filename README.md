You need to be the create of the group and allow for permissions to have the bot in your chat. You can look on the discord documentation to see how to add bots to your group.

this small project is a discord bot that uses external APIs to generate memes and random quotes on a discord chat. It is also capable of changing the role color of a user and creating a new chat channel. You can use the help command to see all available features
